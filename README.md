### Findings:
#### > The total number of admin tickets raised is 3632, and for tech tickets, it is 2955.
#### > As obvious as it sounds, as the number of tickets increases, the churn rate also increases. However, there is more intolerance for tech tickets compared to admin tickets. Individuals who have raised even one ticket are more likely to leave.
#### > Another interesting observation is that as tenure increases, the churn rate decreases. Only in the initial years do we see an increase in the number of churn customers, suggesting that people are happy with the long-term service, but we may not be able to impress them early on in the service.
#### > To support this, we examined the general trend of churn rate with types of contracts. The 1-2 month contract experiences the highest churn compared to 1 and 2-year contracts.
#### > Although more people are using DSL internet service, there is less churn associated with this service compared to Fiber Optic.
#### > Customers who have tech support, online backup, and device protection experience a lower churn rate compared to those who do not have these services.
